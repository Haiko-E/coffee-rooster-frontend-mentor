## My process

I wanted to make use of the new container queries. I found some use cases for it. But i also used media queries for the rest of my application. I also wanted to make use of grid for the cards with images. I didn't want to position them absolute because they will be placed outside of the document flow. It was a little challenge but i managed it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS ( new container queries )
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### Continued development

I want to make a checkout to a payment server. Never implemented that, soo possible gonna intergrate it with Stripe.
